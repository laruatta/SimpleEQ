# `target_sources` adds source files to a target. We pass the target that needs the sources as the
# first argument, then a visibility parameter for the sources which should normally be PRIVATE.
# Finally, we supply a list of source files that will be built into the target. This is a standard
# CMake command.

# `target_compile_definitions` adds some preprocessor definitions to our target. In a Projucer
# project, these might be passed in the 'Preprocessor Definitions' field. JUCE modules also make use
# of compile definitions to switch certain features on/off, so if there's a particular feature you
# need that's not on by default, check the module header for the correct flag to set here. These
# definitions will be visible both to your code, and also the JUCE module code, so for new
# definitions, pick unique names that are unlikely to collide! This is a standard CMake command.

# If your target needs extra binary assets, you can add them here. The first argument is the name of
# a new static library target that will include all the binary resources. There is an optional
# `NAMESPACE` argument that can specify the namespace of the generated binary data class. Finally,
# the SOURCES argument should be followed by a list of source files that should be built into the
# static library. These source files can be of any kind (wav data, images, fonts, icons etc.).
# Conversion to binary-data will happen when your target is built.

# `target_link_libraries` links libraries and JUCE modules to other libraries or executables. Here,
# we're linking our executable target to the `juce::juce_audio_utils` module. Inter-module
# dependencies are resolved automatically, so `juce_core`, `juce_events` and so on will also be
# linked automatically. If we'd generated a binary data target above, we would need to link to it
# here too. This is a standard CMake command.
